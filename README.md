# randomExerciseGenerator
This webpage uses PHP to generate random exercises based on level of difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) as well as sorted by Upper Body, Lower Body, and Cardio.

The .sql file is the current database that is being used but feel free to add or remove exercises as you see fit.

You can also find this hosted on my personal site at http://exercises.redsurgetechnology.com/
